   <p>Hello. Below is Don't Get Hit, a game that was started by my group and I for our ASC Week 2 Milestone project.</p>
   <p>The player plays as a piece of fire  trying to collect the wood bouncing around and avoid the water droplet.</p>
   <p>If the player collects wood, they win. If the water catches them, they lose.</p>
   <p>Once the player wins or loses, they can press the start over button that will bring them back to the title screen. Otherwise, the button doesn't do that.</p>
    <p>The player controls the piece of fire with the arrow keys and can move up, down, left, or right.</p>
   <p> Credits to: The ASC SI program for allowing me to make this game and teaching me how to do so, my group for working with me, and Gerald Lynch for writing the code for the start over button. </p>
   <p>Hope you have fun playing it.</p>
